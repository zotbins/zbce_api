# ZBCE API

There are two parts to gaining full access to the ZotBins Community Edition API: setting up a development environment, and deployment.


# Setting Up Development Environment

# Getting Started
This is the basic outline for setting up your development environment:
1. Cloning Repo in Workspace
2. Setting up Python
3. Installing MySQL
4. Creating a '.env' file
5. Creating Tables in Database
6. Running the Server

### 1 - Cloning ZBCE Repository
Following the instructions listed, you will be able to clone the ZBCE Repository; however, if you would like a more thorough guide/step-by-step, visit the GitHub Docs guide for cloning a repository: https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository.

1. Open an empty folder (or the folder you would like to clone the repo into) and navigate to that folder using a terminal
2. In your terminal, type in `git clone` add a space then paste https://github.com/zotbins/zbce_api.git (Note: you can also find the repo's HTTP URL yourself by clicking the green "Code" button on the top right corner of the ZBCE repo) 
3. Run the command

After these steps, you should be able to access the ZBCE repo from your computer.

### 2 - Setting up Python
1. Download the appropriate Python version for your OS from https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Unzip the python file and follow the Python's setup instructions given

Once Python is downloaded on your device, you will need to create a virtual environment. For a more in depth explanation of creating a virtual Python environment, visit https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html

1. In your terminal type and run `python3 -m venv venv`
2. Activate the virtual environment
   For Windows type and run `venv\Scripts\activate.bat`
   For MacOS or Linux type and run `source venv/bin/activate`
3. Install packages within the virtual environment with `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### 3 - Installing MySQL
1. Download the MySQL workbench and server DB for your OS using https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/
2. Unzip the msi files and follow the setup instructions as given

Once MySQL is installed (workbench and server), you will have to connect to the ZBCE Database.
1. Open MySQL and ‚ÄòStart MySQL Server‚Äô
2. Open MySQLWorkbench	
3. Create a new MySQL Connection
   Connection Name: zotbinsCE
   Hostname: 127.0.0.1
   Port: 3306
   Username: root
   Hit ok and connect to this server
4. Create a new SQL tab: 
5. Run this query once to create the database (click on lightning bolt to run):
   CREATE DATABASE zotbinsCE;

### 4 - Creating a '.env' file
1. Create an .env file in the same directory 
2. Input this into the .env file and change the parameters to match your username and password
    ```
    # change this to specify your MySQL Database
    SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI=mysql+pymysql://YOUR_MYSQL_USERNAME_HERE:YOUR_MYSQL_PASSWORD_HERE@localhost/zotbinsCE

    # this will be used for your flask app, change the following to a secure secret key
    SECRET_KEY=YOUR_HARD_TO_GUESSS_STRING

    # change this to specify where you want the image files to be uploaded to
    # for your upload folder make sure you change the permissions so anyone can modify it using `chmod 777`
    UPLOAD_FOLDER=YOUR_UPLOAD_FOLDER_PATH
    ```
3. Save your changes

### 5 - Creating Tables in Database
1. Create the tables in your database by running `python create_tables.py`
2. If set up successfully, you should see new tables added in mySQL Workbench

### 6 - Running the Server
1. Type and run `python app.py` into your terminal
2. Check where to access your API by looking at ‚ÄúRunning on‚Äù section on the command line
3. Use Postman for further tests if desired

Congratulations you successfully set up your devlopment environment! 



# Deployment


# Prerequisites:
- [Ubuntu 20.04 Operating System](https://ubuntu.com/)
    - other versions might be alright, but have not been tested
- Basic understanding of the Linux Command Line

# Getting Started
These are the basic steps to get started:
1. Setting up the LAMP Server
2. Installing MySQL
3. Git Clone and Setup
4. Create a `.env` File
5. Testing the Server

My instructions are based off of Tanner Crook's Blog, which is really well-written. If you would like more detail for any of the steps I don't explain well just follow his instructions here: [LAMP Stack with Flask](https://db.tannercrook.com/cit-225/lamp-stack-with-flask/)

## 1 - Setting up the LAMP Server
#### Linux
Make sure your server is up to date by running the following commands
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
```
#### Apache
```
sudo apt install apache2
```

#### MySQL
Follow these instructions if you would like more detail: [How to Install MySQl on Ubuntu 20.04](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-mysql-on-ubuntu-20-04)

1. `sudo apt update`
2. `sudo apt install mysql-server`
3. `sudo mysql_secure_installation`
4. Set password for root user from the step above
5. Create a dedicated MySQL User and Grant Privileges using the steps below.
6. `sudo mysql`
7. In the MySQL console run the following commands:
    ```sql
    CREATE USER 'YOURUSERNAME'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'YOURPASSWORD';
    ```
8. Now grant your permissions
    ```sql
    GRANT CREATE, ALTER, DROP, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, SELECT, REFERENCES, RELOAD on *.* TO 'YOURUSERNAME'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;
    ```
9. You can now log in with your new user and password `mysql -u u YOURUSERNAME -p`
10. Create your database using the SQL command: `CREATE DATABASE zotbinsCE`;
11. Exit the MySQL shell: `exit`
11. Remember your username and password üòâ

#### Python
```
sudo apt install python3
sudo apt install python3-venv
sudo apt install python3-pip
```

### FTP (Optional but Recommended)
This step is optional, but is recommended for transferring files to or from the server.
```
sudo apt install vsftpd
sudo nano /etc/vsftpd.conf
```
uncomment the line: `write_enable=YES`

```
sudo service vsftpd restart
```

## 3 - Git Clone and Setting up the Environment
*Following these instructions will be more convenient if you are in superuser mode `su`*

1. Follow these instructions to set up your Apache and WSGI Configuration: [https://db.tannercrook.com/building-a-flask-foundation/](https://db.tannercrook.com/building-a-flask-foundation/)
2. After the step above you should have a working LAMP Stack w/ Flask
3. Now we're going to clone the ZBCE API. So we need to replace the app folder with the repository we are cloning by running the following:
    ```bash
    mv /var/www/app/app /var/www/app/app.bak
    cd /var/www/app
    git clone https://github.com/zotbins/zbce_api
    mv zbce_api app
    ```
4. Now build the virtual environment.
    ```bash
    cd app
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt  
    ```
5. Create a folder for uploading your images and change the permissions.
    ```bash
    cd /var/www/app/app
    mkdir YOUR_UPLOAD_FOLDER_NAME
    chmod 777 YOUR_UPLOAD_FOLDER_NAME
    ```

## 4 - Create a `.env` File
Now that you have the stack setup and your repository and your virtual environment. You want to create a `.env` file with the editor program of your choice or just use nano. This will allow you to store some variables that are supposed to be a secret like passwords, or usernames, etc. We will be using a `.env` to also store sensitive information.

0. In the project directory run: `sudo nano .env`
1. Add the following lines and replace the following portions as specified

    ```bash
    # change this to specify your MySQL Database
    SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI=mysql+pymysql://YOUR_MYSQL_USERNAME_HERE:YOUR_MYSQL_PASSWORD_HERE@localhost/zotbinsCE

    # this will be used for your flask app, change the following to a secure secret key
    SECRET_KEY=YOUR_HARD_TO_GUESSS_STRING

    # change this to specify where you want the image files to be uploaded to
    # for your upload folder make sure you change the permissions so anyone can modify it using `chmod 777`
    UPLOAD_FOLDER=YOUR_UPLOAD_FOLDER_PATH
    ```
2. Close and save the file.
3. In `config.py` Turn off or turn on Debugging options. You should turn off debugging, when you want your server to run in production mode: `app.config['DEBUG'] = True # turn this off when not debugging.`

## 5 - Testing the Server
Alright, everything should be set now!
1. Reboot your server: `reboot`
2. Open the `unit_tests.py` file and change the following:
    ```
    BASEURL = "YOUR_URL"
    IPADDRESS = "YOUR_IP_ADDRESS"
    ```
3. Save and close the file
4. Run the unit tests
    ```
    su
    cd /var/www/app/app
    pytest -q unit_tests.py
    ```
5. If there are no error messages everything should be good!
